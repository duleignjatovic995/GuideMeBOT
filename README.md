Project started as a Facebook Messenger BOT for helping refugees with key information in Serbia.

First part of app is keyword mapping to information on our base platform www.guide.me,
and the search engine based recommendation of url's of previously cawled web pages of interest for refugees.

Next thing to do is to habilitate neural net and adding new algorithms for better functionality.
